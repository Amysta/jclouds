jclouds
======

__The upstream repository is at https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds. This is Amysta's version of [Apache jclouds](http://jclouds.apache.org/), created to fit our internal needs (release calendar, patches, etc.). Patches are contributed back to the upstream project, and upstream patches are integrated as well.__


Apache jclouds is an open source multi-cloud toolkit for the Java platform that gives you the freedom to create applications that are portable across clouds while giving you full control to use cloud-specific features.
